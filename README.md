## Description
cool-retro-term is a terminal emulator which mimics the look and feel of the old cathode tube screens.
It has been designed to be eye-candy, customizable, and reasonably lightweight.

It uses the QML port of qtermwidget (Konsole): https://github.com/Swordfish90/qmltermwidget.

This terminal emulator works under Linux and macOS and requires Qt6.

Settings such as colors, fonts, and effects can be accessed via context menu.

## Install

If you want to get a hold of the latest version, just go to the Releases page and grab the latest AppImage (Linux) or dmg (macOS).

Alternatively, most distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora or Arch already package cool-retro-term in their official repositories.

## Command line

cool-retro-term can run a command on startup with `-e`:

```sh
cool-retro-term -e top
```

It can also open a telnet connection on startup:

```sh
cool-retro-term --telnet-host example.com --telnet-port 23
```

For telnet servers that prompt for credentials, cool-retro-term can send a username and password when it detects login and password prompts:

```sh
cool-retro-term --telnet-host example.com --telnet-user myuser --telnet-password mypass
```

The telnet options use the system `telnet` command, so `telnet` must be installed and available in `PATH`. Passing passwords on the command line can expose them through shell history or process listings.
