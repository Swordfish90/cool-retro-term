#cool-retro-term

##Description
cool-retro-term is a terminal emulator which mimics the look and feel of the old cathode tube screens.
It has been designed to be eye-candy, customizable, and reasonably lightweight.

It uses the Konsole engine which is powerful and mature.

This terminal emulator requires Qt 5.2 or higher to run.
