/**
    \brief An image of characters with associated attributes.

    The terminal emulation ( Emulation ) receives a serial stream of
    characters from the program currently running in the terminal.
    From this stream it creates an image of characters which is ultimately
    rendered by the display widget ( TerminalDisplay ).  Some types of emulation
    may have more than one screen image.

    getImage() is used to retrieve the currently visible image
    which is then used by the display widget to draw the output from the
    terminal.

    The number of lines of output history which are kept in addition to the current
    screen image depends on the history scroll being used to store the output.
    The scroll is specified using setScroll()
    The output history can be retrieved using writeToStream()

    The screen image has a selection associated with it, specified using
    setSelectionStart() and setSelectionEnd().  The selected text can be retrieved
    using selectedText().  When getImage() is used to retrieve the visible image,
    characters which are part of the selection have their colours inverted.
