/**
 * Base class for terminal emulation back-ends.
 *
 * The back-end is responsible for decoding an incoming character stream and
 * producing an output image of characters.
 *
 * When input from the terminal is received, the receiveData() slot should be called with
 * the data which has arrived.  The emulation will process the data and update the
 * screen image accordingly.  The codec used to decode the incoming character stream
 * into the unicode characters used internally can be specified using setCodec()
 *
 * The size of the screen image can be specified by calling setImageSize() with the
 * desired number of lines and columns.  When new lines are added, old content
 * is moved into a history store, which can be set by calling setHistory().
 *
 * The screen image can be accessed by creating a ScreenWindow onto this emulation
 * by calling createWindow().  Screen windows provide access to a section of the
 * output.  Each screen window covers the same number of lines and columns as the
 * image size returned by imageSize().  The screen window can be moved up and down
 * and provides transparent access to both the current on-screen image and the
 * previous output.  The screen windows emit an outputChanged signal
 * when the section of the image they are looking at changes.
 * Graphical views can then render the contents of a screen window, listening for notifications
 * of output changes from the screen window which they are associated with and updating
 * accordingly.
 *
 * The emulation also is also responsible for converting input from the connected views such
 * as keypresses and mouse activity into a character string which can be sent
 * to the terminal program.  Key presses can be processed by calling the sendKeyEvent() slot,
 * while mouse events can be processed using the sendMouseEvent() slot.  When the character
 * stream has been produced, the emulation will emit a sendData() signal with a pointer
 * to the character buffer.  This data should be fed to the standard input of the terminal
 * process.  The translation of key presses into an output character stream is performed
 * using a lookup in a set of key bindings which map key sequences to output
 * character sequences.  The name of the key bindings set used can be specified using
 * setKeyBindings()
 *
 * The emulation maintains certain state information which changes depending on the
 * input received.  The emulation can be reset back to its starting state by calling
 * reset().
 *
 * The emulation also maintains an activity state, which specifies whether
 * terminal is currently active ( when data is received ), normal
 * ( when the terminal is idle or receiving user input ) or trying
 * to alert the user ( also known as a "Bell" event ).  The stateSet() signal
 * is emitted whenever the activity state is set.  This can be used to determine
 * how long the emulation has been active/idle for and also respond to
 * a 'bell' event in different ways.
